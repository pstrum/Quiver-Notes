To do this we:\n\n- Loop through all numbers from 2 up until the number itself (half the number, actually, i <= n/2)\n- Check to see if each number is divisible (the remainder is 0; n % i === 0)\n- If a number is divisible, stop the loop and return `false`.\n- If no numbers are divisible, then return `true`"
