Given the required height, can you print a staircase as shown in the example?\n\n##Input \n\nYou are given an integer N depicting the height of the staircase.\n\n## Output \n\nPrint a staircase of height N that consists of # symbols and spaces. For example for N=6, here's a staircase of that height:\n\n     #\n    ##\n   ###\n  ####\n #####\n######\n\n**Note**: The last line has 0 spaces before it."
