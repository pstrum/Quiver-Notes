The metaphor I see most often, and specifically from Kyle Simpson, is the `this` can be thought of like the address to  building that you can then enter and go up floor by floor to access what you need. This is a big part of object oriented programing, because when you create a `new` object using a constructor function, `this` will then point to the new object that was created and it can trace back up the prototype linkage to find what you need."
